Javascript
1. What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. It can be used both on the client-side and server-side. JavaScript is known for its flexibility and versatility, making it a popular choice for web development.

- What is dynamic in “dynamic web application”?
In the context of web applications, "dynamic" refers to the ability of a web page or application to respond to user interactions or changes in data without requiring a page refresh.

2. Data types
Primitive: (primitive this case means basic)
 - Number
 - String
 - Boolean
 - null

The Symbol data type represents a unique identifier.
const mySymbol = Symbol();
const anotherSymbol = Symbol();
console.log(mySymbol === anotherSymbol); // false
